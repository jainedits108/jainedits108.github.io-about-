      <p>
        I didn’t start with a plan — I started with a passion.<br><br>
        Jain_edits108 began as a simple idea: to bring Jain Dharma into the digital world in a way that actually resonates. No fluff. No over-explaining. Just raw, powerful stories, edits, and concepts that speak to the soul.<br><br>
        But behind the screen?<br><br>
        Just one person — learning, exploring, editing, researching, and designing out of love for Jainism. I’m not a scholar or guru — I’m just someone who fell in love with Jainism and wanted others to experience its depth.<br><br>
        As the journey grew, so did the community. What started as an idea turned into a shared vision, connecting people who resonate with this message. Every post, every edit, every message is part of something larger than just one person’s effort — it’s a movement to preserve and share our rich Dharma.<br><br>
        This isn’t just a page. It’s a vault of effort, late nights, drafts that never made it, and messages that changed lives — including mine.
